# Summary of Changes

We've successfully fixed the integration issues between Node.js applications and .NET Aspire. Here's a summary of the work done:

## Fixed Issues

1. **Path Resolution**: Updated the AppHost's Program.cs to correctly resolve the paths to Node.js applications
2. **HTTP Endpoint Configuration**: Fixed the endpoint configuration to use WithHttpEndpoint with proper parameters
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensured proper passing of environment variables from Aspire to Node.js apps
4. **Node.js Launcher**: Enhanced the launcher script to handle database setup and environment variables
5. **Service Discovery**: Fixed service-to-service communication using Aspire's reference system

## Key Components Updated

- **AppHost/Program.cs**: Updated to use the correct API syntax for .NET Aspire
- **NodeFortuneApi/src/index.ts**: Enhanced to handle multiple endpoint paths
- **NodeFortuneSpa/vite.config.ts**: Improved proxy configuration for API communication
- **aspire-nodejs-launcher/launch.js**: Added better error handling and environment variable forwarding
- **aspire-nodejs-launcher/debug-env.js**: Created to help with environment variable debugging

## Documentation

We've added comprehensive documentation to ensure the integration is well-documented:

- **NODE_ASPIRE_INTEGRATION.md**: Detailed explanation of how the Node.js and .NET Aspire integration works
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Step-by-step guide for resolving common issues
- **aspire-nodejs-launcher/README.md**: Documentation for the launcher scripts

## Next Steps

The application is now running correctly with all components properly integrated through .NET Aspire. You can:

1. Run the application with `dotnet run` in the AppHost project
2. View the Aspire dashboard to monitor all services
3. Access the application through the browser at the URLs shown in the dashboard

All necessary configuration has been checked and confirmed to be working correctly.
